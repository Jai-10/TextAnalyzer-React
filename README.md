Here's the link: https://jai-10.github.io/TextAnalyzer-React/

TextAnalyzer-React is my first react application.
I'm a CSE student and this will be one of many projects that'll be hosted here.

TextAnalyzer is an app that lets the user play around or work wiht the text in some ways.
I'll definitely be adding more and more features here.. So stay tuned.

Thank you for spending your time and checking out this repo and the app itself. Have a great day!

(PS: I have a slight better version of this site where react router is being used; but I didn't upload it as there's some issue between gh-pages and react router. I tried to upload it on heroku but had the same issue. Let me know if you have a solution for this. Thank you.)
